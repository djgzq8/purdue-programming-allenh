How is a semaphore created in DLXOS?
	sem_t SemCreate(int count)
	returns a handle to a semaphore with an internal counter initialized to

	sem_wait 
	disables interrupts
	it sleeps the process if the sem is going to be less than zero
	decrements the internal semaphore counter
	enables interrupts
	
	sem_signal 
	disables interrupts
	if the semaphore is greater than zero and
	if there is a process in the waiting queue
	the first process from the queue is woken up
	enables interrupts
