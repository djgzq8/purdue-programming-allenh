from the lab5 directory, run make lottery to view the lottery results of each user program.

run make reaction to see the reactions run with no other debugging outputs.

Run make all to compile only the programs considered in our solution.

In process.c, change the macro SCHEDULER to LT_SCHED to use the lottery scheduler, and RR_SCHED to use
the original round robin scheduler.

Note: For the reactions, since only 10 messages are allowed per mailbox and
more O2 is created than used. Eventually the mailbox used for O2 will become full and 
cause the programs to exit while others are waiting. If this happens, use smaller parameters. 
It should tell you when it can't work, but just in case.

Dan Sabo collaborated with us for the first part because he was having teammate issues.
